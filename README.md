Display ace stories using a custom template

How do I use this?

After you have cloned the file down, replace the #storyJson script tag with the ace stories formatted as JSON.

example:

<script type="text/javascript" id='storyJson'>
  /* Put the stories json from ace here: */
  [{"story": '...'}]
</script>

Load the page in a browser and whabam!! stories.
